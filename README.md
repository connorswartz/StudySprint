# vite-typescript-tailwind-temp
 This is a template file for creating a vite app with React , Typescript and Tailwind CSS
 Tailwind is configured right out of the box and alot of extra files have been deleted.
 Pretty much starting fresh with no fuss
 
# How to run
 After clonning the files, run:
 ```
 npm install
 npm run dev
 
 ````
 And thats it!
